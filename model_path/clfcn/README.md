Download our CLFCN model paths from [HERE](https://www.roboticlab.eu/claude/models/) and put them in this directory. 
We provide three paths corresponding to rgb, lidar, and cross_fusion modalities.  

When validating or visualizing the models, specify the model path in the 
'config.json' ['General']['model_path'].
